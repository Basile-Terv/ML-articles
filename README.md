# ML-articles

During the MVA masters at ENS Paris-Saclay, I worked with people from MILA, and we published our article [Improving Molecular Modeling with Geometric GNNs: an Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08313) in a ICML 2024 workshop.

At the end of my 2nd year at Polytechnique, I did a 3 months-research internship at STMicroelectronics, working on Reinforcement learning using GNNs. The application was to help human designers size analog electronic circuits. The article [Reinforcement Learning for Analog Sizing Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10192204) mentions me in the acknowledgements. I you do not have an IEEE account, I can send you the pdf file by e-mail.
