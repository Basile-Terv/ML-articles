# ML-articles

At the end of my 2nd year at Polytechnique, I did a 3 months-research internship at STMicroelectronics, working on Reinforcement learning using GNNs. The application was to help human designers size analog electronic circuits. The article [Reinforcement Learning for Analog Sizing Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10192204) mentions me in the acknowledgements.
